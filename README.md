# The Toybox Project

A forum application.

## General Knowledge:

[+] Understand function `reverse()` and its role in `HttpResponseRedirect( reverse(...) )`.

[+] I noticed in some packages, the urls.py file contains multiple patterns, (a `forum_patterns` followed by a `topic_patterns` followed by a `url_patterns`).  How does this work?
